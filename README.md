## Why was this robot created?

I live in Iran and because of the intense filtering,
it is easier to use telegram with proxy and more
accessible, and I thought I could use the telegram
when I couldn't access Instagram to upload my own
content into my [Instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/barnamenevisiinsta).
So I also made this robot Open Source for those
friends who love to run this robot on their
personal server and can use it or do not trust
the [robot](https://t.me/InstagramAssistantRobot) for any reason.

`vim .env` or `nano .env`
