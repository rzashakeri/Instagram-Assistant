## Why was this robot created?
I live in Iran and because of the intense filtering, 
it is easier to use telegram with proxy and more 
accessible, and I thought I could use the telegram 
when I couldn't access Instagram to upload my own 
content into my [Instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/barnamenevisiinsta).
So I also made this robot Open Source for those 
friends who love to run this robot on their 
personal server and can use it or do not trust 
the [robot](https://t.me/InstagramAssistantRobot) for any reason.
